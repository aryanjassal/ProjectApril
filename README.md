# Welcome to Project April

This is an operating system I'm working on as a hobby. I have dubbed this operating system "Project April" or simply "AprilOS".

## How do I run this?

To run the operating system, you need to first clone this repository. Then, run the following command in the same directory where the `Makefile` is located. Please note that you need to have the `qemu`, `nasm`, and `gcc` packages installed in order to run this operating system.
  
```bash
make
```

And that's it! This should compile the operating system and open up a QEMU window with the operating system.
