    db 11001111b    ; First 4 bits (1111b) is another part of the limit. The rest 4 bits are flags. Go to the osdev wiki and look at the Flags table.

  ; This defines the data segment of the GDT

    ; ------v--- this bit controls the data segment growing up or down. The aforementioned osdever site is giving contradictory information about this.
